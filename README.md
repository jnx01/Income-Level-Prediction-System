## Income Level Prediciton System

- Build a model that can accurately predict whether a person is earning above the $50,000 threshold or 
otherwise.
- The model should have a small error so that its results are dependable.
- Also develop a user-friendly and interactive GUI for the app so that any non-technical person can easily use 
the model
